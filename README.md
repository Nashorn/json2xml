# Intro
I like xml. I like json. I like javascript.
So I made a little tool to convert from json to xml.

## Changelog
Last version is v0.1  
*  v0.1 (demo [here](http://dev.federalbureauofinhumanity.org/json2xml/v0.1/)) : initial version

# How to use
First, import the json2xml.js.  
Then, do something like this : 
<pre>var xml = json2xml.convert(obj, "data");</pre>
This will convert your json object (obj) to xml.

## Parameters

The json2xml.convert function needs 2 parameters :  
*  The json object (called "obj" in the example).  
*  The xml root name ("data" in the example).
